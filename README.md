# MVC CRUD
### A project that allows you to add, remove, and edit information about corn mazes. Based on the assignment to have editable objects in set online.

## Developer
* Erik Ernst

## Technologies
* Spring
* Gradle
* HTML
* CSS
* Java

## Future Edits
* Given more time I would improve the CSS layout of the site. Functionality was priority one.
* I would also allow more information, and user feedback on the cornmazes.
* I would clean up the edit method so it is more directly affecting the properties.

##Stumbling Blocks
* The main issues resulted from things in the edit, and remove taking longer than expected.
